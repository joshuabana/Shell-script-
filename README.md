# Shell-script-
Generation of multiplication table with linux shell scripting 
I was able to generate a multiplication table using linux shell scripting that prompts users input for a partial or full multiplication table
The core challenge i faced was trying to understand the various statements required to make the conditions work
basically the if statements and for loops
